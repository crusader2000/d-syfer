3) Make a PR

Other ways to contribute-

a)Make the Readme better

b)Add a github.io site for the repository

c)Inform others about this to others

d)Add tutorials on verilog and combinational/sequential circuits

e)Give a brief explanation of various circuits. For example, add a readme about 4_bit_ripple_carry_adder which has its working and a diagram of it.
